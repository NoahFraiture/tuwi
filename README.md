# tuwi

> :warning: : this project is working but mostly in working. This can be considered as an alpha release. There's known issue like width not adapted and more. Bubble tea recently had changes and a new framework "Huh?" came out. To adapt tuwi to it, there's need a lot of refactoring, I will to it someday, but not today. Feel free to make PR if you want to correct these issue

A terminal user interface application to chat with AI such as the different GPT models, DALL-E 3, and Bard. This project has no final goal and may evolve in the future if I want to do cool stuff, but it should stay in the same flow.

## Explanation 

This project is written in Go with the framework Bubble Tea https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea 

~~The database is couchDB~~

The database system has recently be re-written to simply handle file on the file system of the user

# Usage

1. You should make a `db` directory that will store the conversations
2. You need to create a file `key` with your openai key
3. Run the project with `go run  /path/to/tuwi`
4. Chat

You can navigate with vim motion as displayed in the help menu. Ctrl-z to go back in navigation and ctrl-s on chat to save the conversation 

## Plans

- The new database management came with difficulties to handle. 
  - [ ] Encrypt the data stored in clear, such as conversation history and OpenAI key, for security and privacy reasons
  - [ ] Implement Peterson's algorithm to handle concurrency and block users from loading the same conversation multiple times. Otherwise, the conversations may become unsynchronized and data may be lost.

- Integration of dall-e 3 :
  - [ ] Add a function to call the API and query the image from the given URL.
  - [ ] Implement a more complex solution to display the image in the terminal, compatible with different terminals.

- [ ] Integrate Bard and more AI models.
- [ ] Restructure the project structure.
- [ ] Ask the user for their key at the first connection.
- [ ] Add the possibility to save system messages.
- [ ] Make the help menu more complete.


# Known issue
- Artifact on AI list from the conversation list
